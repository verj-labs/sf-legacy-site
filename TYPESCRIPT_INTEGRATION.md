# TypeScript Vehicle Interface Integration

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for vehicle data to prepare for Sanity CMS integration. This provides full type safety and proper data modeling for your dealership inventory system.

## Created TypeScript Interfaces

### 1. `/src/types/vehicle.ts` - Comprehensive Vehicle Interface
- **VehicleImage**: Image asset structure with Sanity references
- **VehicleFeature**: Individual feature with descriptions
- **VehicleWarranty**: Warranty information (powertrain, comprehensive, extended)
- **VehicleFinancing**: Financing details (monthly payment, down payment, APR, terms)
- **VehicleHistory**: Vehicle history and condition reports
- **VehicleInspection**: Inspection details and certifications
- **VehicleLocation**: Dealership location information
- **VehicleContact**: Sales contact information
- **Vehicle**: Main comprehensive vehicle interface with 50+ properties

### 2. `/src/types/basic-vehicle.ts` - Essential Vehicle Interface
- **BasicVehicleImage**: Simplified image structure
- **BasicVehicle**: Essential fields matching your requirements:
  - title, odometer, bodyType, stockNum, transmission
  - engineDesc, make, model/trim, year, vin
  - fuelType, drivetrain, exteriorColor, interiorColor
  - vehicle overview, options and accessories

## Updated Components

### 1. Vehicle Detail Page (`/src/app/inventory/[id]/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Converted to use `DetailedVehicle` interface
- ✅ Fixed all property references (engine → engineDesc, stock → stockNum, etc.)
- ✅ Added proper null checking for optional properties
- ✅ Updated image handling for Sanity asset structure
- ✅ Safe handling of financing and warranty optional fields

### 2. Inventory Listing Page (`/src/app/inventory/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Converted to use `BasicVehicle` interface
- ✅ Updated all mock data to match new structure
- ✅ Fixed filtering and sorting to use correct property names
- ✅ Updated vehicle cards to use new property names
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Key Changes Made

### Property Name Updates
| Old Property | New Property | Type |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| `id` | `_id` | string |
| `mileage` | `odometer` | number |
| `engine` | `engineDesc` | string |
| `stock` | `stockNum` | string |
| `bodyStyle` | `bodyType` | enum |
| `image` | `images` | array |

### Type Safety Improvements
- All components now have proper TypeScript interfaces
- Optional properties are safely handled with null checking
- Sanity CMS compatible data structure
- Proper enum types for fuel types, body types, drivetrain options
- Type guards for runtime type checking

### Sanity CMS Preparation
- Image assets structured for Sanity references
- Document structure with `_id`, `_type` fields
- Slug field for URL generation
- Status and featured flags for content management

## Benefits
1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
2. **IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and intellisense
3. **Sanity Ready**: Data structure matches Sanity CMS patterns
4. **Maintainable**: Clear interfaces make code easier to understand
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new properties as needed

## Next Steps for Sanity Integration
1. Create Sanity schemas based on these TypeScript interfaces
2. Set up Sanity Studio with vehicle document types
3. Configure image handling and CDN
4. Replace mock data with Sanity queries
5. Add content management workflows

## Build Status
✅ **All TypeScript compilation errors resolved**
✅ **Next.js build successful**
✅ **All pages render correctly**
✅ **Type safety maintained throughout**

The codebase is now fully prepared for Sanity CMS integration with proper TypeScript support.

Current page is very good but taking up too much space and has too much clutter. We need to cut down. You can keep some of the things but align it in the following direction.

Tagline (“Where EXPERIENCE exceeds your EXPECTATIONS!”), dealership address/phone. A hero section encouraging users to shop for used cars and book a test drive. “Featured Vehicles” carousel showing images of specific vehicles. Four‑step process for buying a car (select your car, book test drive, pay cash/get financing, drive home). Sections for satisfaction guarantee, warranty overview, financing description, CTA to contact. Footer lists popular makes/models/body styles and contact details.
